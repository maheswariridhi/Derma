the entire point is to create a layout where i want to create an area where patients can understand their treatments better:

1.this is a dermatology focused clinic so after the patient talks to doctor instead of the doctor having to write down the treatment and medication on paper they can have a quick document here but now how to make it so that it is easy to enter the medication and treatment using ai agents

2. the entire point of this page is to be able to send this page to the patient wheret they can interact with it to understand more about their treatment

3.there should be a why is this important for you (for each medication+treatment--how do i design this


Here's the game plan:

AI-Powered Input:

Add smart input fields where the doctor can quickly speak or type treatment details.
Use AI (like your chatbot or recommendation component) to auto-populate fields for medications and treatment plans.
Allow the doctor to review and edit AI suggestions before finalizing.
Patient-Interactive Document:

Design the page to be shareable (secure URL or portal) so patients can interact with their treatment plan.
Make sections clickable so patients can drill down for more info or ask follow-up questions via the chatbot.
"Why is this important for you?" Section:

For each medication or treatment, integrate an info icon or expandable panel.
When clicked, show a concise explanation of the benefits, potential side effects, and relevance to their dermatological care.
Use tooltips or popovers (Mantineâ€™s Tooltip or Popover components work great) to keep the UI clean but informative.
